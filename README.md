# TASK-6
This guide demonstrates how to build and evaluate a Linear Regression model using the California Housing dataset. It begins by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and performing basic inspection to understand the structure, data types, and value ranges. The input features and continuous target variable are then separated and split into training and testing sets. A Linear Regression model is trained on the training data and used to make predictions on the test set. Model performance is evaluated using error metrics such as MAE and RMSE, and results are visualized by plotting predicted versus actual values. Finally, the model coefficients are analyzed to identify which features have the strongest influence on housing prices.
